## Summary

This Chrome extension project has **critical quality issues** that prevent release:

1. **Test System Failure**: 91 out of 372 tests are failing (24.5% failure rate) due to fundamental ES module compatibility issues
2. **Quality Toolchain Broken**: ESLint configuration prevents code quality validation
3. **Security Concerns**: Overly broad content script permissions

**Recommendation**: Implement quality freeze period to fix toolchain and testing infrastructure before any feature development continues.

**Estimated Fix Time**: 11 hours of focused engineering effort.

**Quality Score**: 60/100 (down from incorrectly reported 80/100)
